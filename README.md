### Description

I had two main goals when starting the project. The first is that I wanted to expand my knowledge in Hough Transform (circles and lines detection). The second is that I wanted to do a project related to painting because I really like to paint. For these reasons, I chose to use Hough Transform methods to detect a tennis ball and a marker in real-time. In this project I implemented a code that does the following:

1. Using a web camera, it can detect if there is a tennis ball or marker in the video frame. If a marker is detected, the color of the marker is detected as well (orange, blue or purple).
2. Track the ball or the marker as it moves inside the frame and draw the trail of the ball/marker.
